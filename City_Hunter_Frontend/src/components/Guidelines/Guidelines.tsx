              <p>
                Losing or misplacing your property can be frustrating and become
                such a hassle to find. At Lostings we answer that by providing
                an intelligent lost and found matching system, which
                automatically identifies, matches, and pairs recently lost or
                found items with one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Weâ€™ve also partnered with local and regional businesses to
                submit found items into our matching system. This helps to
                maximize reach and gives users a higher rate of success when
                attempting to locate and find lost property.

                As a team of City Hunter, we always do our best to re-unite
                passengers with their lost items but our ability to do so is
                dependent on factors outside our control:

              <p>
                (a) the item being found

                (b) the found item being handed in
                <br></br>
                (c) the time it takes for the finder to get the found item
              </p>
              <p>
                If the item does not reach a <a href="">Lost Property</a> from
                our online platform, we will not be able to assist. Please be
                aware not all lost items are found and handed in.
